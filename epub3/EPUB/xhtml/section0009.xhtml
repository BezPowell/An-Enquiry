    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>There is an old proverb which says that someone who asks a question is a fool for five minutes, but those who do not ask are fools for the rest of their lives. There is another saying which states that “If it ‘aint broke, don’t fix it” which obviously implies that if something is broken, the sensible thing to do would be to fix it. For a very long time society has been broken for everyone barr a tiny minority. If we do not try and fix it, what does that say about ourselves?</p>
    <p>No Gods. No Masters.</p>
